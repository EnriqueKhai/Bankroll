# Overview.

How much does one need to save each month to acheive financial independence? If I
need `$2000` per month to retire now, how much is that in 40 years time? With
`Bankroll`, all of these questions can be answered. Simply fill out key information
such as expected return (annualized) of investments and gross monthly salary (before
CPF) and the rest will be computed for you!
